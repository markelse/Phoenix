WELCOME TO PHOENIX

I am new to PHP and this is my first attempt at a full PHP script.

I decided to build this script because I needed to make a script for a project of mine that allowed
 users to register for an account and then login to a members area.

After much reading and learning (and many headaches too!) what you see in front of you is the on-going
 result of everything I know.

Currently the Phoenix script run on PHP & MYSQL and has currently only been tested locally on a development server.

To install simply run the included install.sql file, register an account and then login.
